# Insurance Premium Prediction
Insurance premium predictor will predict the cost of the insurance plan which gives the individual, an idea as to what kind of insurance premium they can prefer over a certain period of time looking at the constraints and viabilities of the insurance plan.

### Problem Statement
Insurance are beneficial to anyone looking to protect their family, assets/property and themselves from financial risk/losses. Insurance plans will help you pay for medical emergencies, hospitalisation, contraction of any illnesses and treatment, and medical care required in the future. The financial loss to the family due to the unfortunate death of the sole earner can be covered by insurance plans. This is a regression problem, in which persons information and health details are taken to predict how much espense is required for their insurance premium.

### Solution Proposed
In this project the goal is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. The problem is to find the expense of the insurance premium which can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.
